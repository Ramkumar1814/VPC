# VPC
## AIM: 
  To study the steps involved in setting up a private cloud using AWS or Microsoft Azure platforms and explore its core features and services. 

## PROCEDURE: 
1. Create a Cloud Account:
   -Sign up for an account on AWS or Microsoft Azure.
   - Complete verification using email and credit card information. 
2. Set up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):
   - In AWS: Use the VPC Dashboard to create a new VPC.
   - In Azure: Create a Virtual Network (VNet) from the Azure Portal. 
3. Configure Subnets and Routing:
   - Define public and private subnets.
   - Set up route tables to control traffic flow. 
4. Create and Launch Instances:
    - Launch EC2 (AWS) or Virtual Machine (Azure) instances inside the VPC or VNet.
    - Assign instances to appropriate subnets. 
5. Security Configuration:
   - Create and assign security groups or Network Security Groups (NSGs).
   - Set up inbound/outbound rules for communication. 
6. Storage and Networking:
   - Attach storage (EBS/Azure Disks).
   - Configure load balancers and gateways if needed. 
7. Testing:
   - Verify connectivity between instances.
   - Test access.

## RESULT: 
A private cloud environment was successfully created using the AWS/Azure platform. Key components such as VPC/VNet, subnets, instances, and security groups were configured. The environment was tested and verified for internal communication and external access as per the configuration.
